            <p>Many South Africans experience adverse outcomes following medical treatment or surgical procedures. Not only is the patient left to deal with ongoing pain, disability or decreased quality of life, but there is also long-lasting psychological trauma that is not dealt with.</p>

            <p>Although there has been a notable increase in medical litigation in South Africa, a prominent law firm in South Africa has reported that only 2 out of 10 patients who seek opinion for possible malpractice lawsuit have a valid claim. Of these, Only half of potential claims in which summons are issued are successful. These lawsuits are complex and it may be up to 10 years before a verdict is reached. The extent of the psychological trauma that the patient experiences during this period cannot be quantified.</p>
            <p>Neither the medial nor the legal system offers useful special or long term psychological, clinical or social support to those who have experienced adverse outcomes from medical procedures.  They are left to deal alone with the social, clinical and psychological ramifications of the adverse outcome. Those who pin their hopes on the legal system find that there may be no solution there and that, if there is, it results only in a monetary reward for a few who are lucky to be successful.<b> Our health practitioners in the private and public sector have not developed systems to offer holistic, coordinated, long-term support to this vulnerable group of people.</b></p>
            <p>Even in cases where parents seek care for their children for birth complications like cerebral palsy, the care provided it is often uncoordinated and the practitioners manage these patients in isolation. The people affected and their families are not connected to other forms of social support, like non-profit organisations, which are available. Parents may also need information on schools which are available and appropriate for the needs of their children. These children, who need long-term follow-up care for many years are often lost to the health practitioners, and the health practitioners have no mechanism to facilitate appropriate long-term care.</p>

            <p>We aim to provide long-term medical, psychological and social support for those who have had an adverse outcome following a medical or surgical procedure, with a special focus on those who develop long term neurological complications like cerebral palsy. We will also ensure that these individuals are not deprived of medical care due to financial problems by obtaining authorisation for procedures with medical aids and providing financial assistance where necessary, and possibly negotiating pro bono service with specialists working in the health unit. </p>
